# Codetest

# Requirements
  - [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [net 5.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
  - [net 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)

# Before we start
  - Clone repository
  - Install dependencie (should be done automatically when running the project):
```sh
    cd Frontend
    npm i
    dotnet restore
```
### Run:
  - Use the debug function in either visual studio or vs code
  - Or just run this command:
```sh
dotnet run Frontend/Frontend.csproj
```

# Gerneral information about the project
The project is a standard dotnet core 5.0 MCV project.

No libraries are used in the javascript. We utilize Gulp to bundle and compile both the TypeScript and the SCSS.

# Database
  - We use a mongodb for this project, but feel free to switch if you prefer another option.
  - The database is publicly open, and the connectionstring in the appsettings.json is filled in, ready and working.

# Controllers:
## Modal Controller:
Modal controller returns html from a view. Useful in e.g. modals or ajax like calls.
  - [Route("api/[controller]/[action]")]
  
## User Controller:
Get users, update users, delete users.
  - [Route("api/[controller]/[action]")]

## Home Controller:
Returns your base-view.
  - [Route("[controller]/[action]")]
  
# Test objectives:
In general, we want to have at least some code in the following three languages.
  - C#
  - Javascript (TypeScript)
  - CSS (SCSS)

Using any external library is allowed, the same goes for old code in your repository. Utilizing external libraries does have to be utilized for a good reason though.

## The test (Whats your task)
### Basic CRUD operations
Add basic CRUD oparations to the application.

### Web Components
When doing frontend, we use web components so we can have reusable and framework agnostic code. We prefer you do components in "web components"
Check *Frontend/Scripts/WebComponents/UserModal.component.ts* for inspiration on how to create web components.

### Improve layout (optional)
The current layout is very simple, if you could improve it, it would be a big benefit.

### Improve logging (optional)
Logging can always be improved, see if you could add your touch to the logging.

### UnitTesting (optional)
Unit testing could be a very nice addition to this project.

# What do we find important
- Think scalable. Our solution needs to be maintainable and scalable.
- Write readable code, with meaningfull function and variable names
- Extract your code to classes where a class or a function only have one specific purpose
- Only write comments, if code is not self-explainatory(which it should be for the most part)
- Try to write your own code. Importing libraries has to be for a good reason. We rate it very highly that you are able to write your own code
